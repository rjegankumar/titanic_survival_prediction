There's still more work you can do in feature engineering:

Try using features related to the cabins.
See if any family size features might help. Do the number of women in a family make the entire family more likely to survive?
Does the national origin of the passenger's name have anything to do with survival?

There's also a lot more we can do on the algorithm side:

Try the random forest classifier in the ensemble.
A support vector machine might work well with this data.
We could try neural networks.
Boosting with a different base classifier might work better.

And with ensembling methods:

Could majority voting be a better ensembling method than averaging probabilities?
